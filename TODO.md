# TODOs for FSG

## Very bad

- hotkeys blocking inputs in text fields

## Bad

- close tagging dialog when clicking outside of it
- multiselect in grid view
- filter for upload with query parameter, etc

## Not so bad

- delete cameras
- add pagination or infiniscroll to project tags
- tag ui broken when tag description too long
- applied tag shows up locally as "manual" even though it might be "custom"
